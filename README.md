# QR-Code-Generator
 
This repository is a qr code generator made with python using both PyQt5 and Kivy. This program can convert plain strings and urls all through a simple gui. The project will also over executable files for each version in the releases section of this github repsitory.
- Kivy is still in progress and I expect to be able to create an apk with its cross platform abilities.

- This is a very simple program and I hope this will help beginners to learn at python and both Kivy and PyQt5.
